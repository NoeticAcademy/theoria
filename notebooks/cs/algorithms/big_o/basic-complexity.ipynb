    "### 0/1 Knapsack Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **0/1 Knapsack Problem** is a classical optimization problem in computer science and dynamic programming. Here's the problem definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a set of **n items**, each with:\n",
    "- A **weight** $w_i$\n",
    "- A **value** $v_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you are provided with a **knapsack** that has a **maximum weight capacity** $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to **maximize the total value** of the items that can be placed in the knapsack, without exceeding the weight capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0/1 Property:\n",
    "\n",
    "The name **0/1** refers to the fact that for each item, you have two choices:\n",
    "- **Include** the item in the knapsack (i.e., take it).\n",
    "- **Exclude** the item from the knapsack (i.e., leave it behind).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each item, you can either select it or not select it (hence the \"0 or 1\" choice for each item).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- $n$ items, each with weight $w_i$ and value $v_i$\n",
    "- A knapsack with weight capacity $W$\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Maximize} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i v_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to the constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i w_i \\leq W\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $x_i$ is a binary variable indicating whether item $i$ is included in the knapsack (1 if included, 0 if not).\n",
    "- $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for all $i$, which means you either take or leave the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a knapsack problem with the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item | Weight $w_i$ | Value $v_i$ |\n",
    "|------|--------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1    | 2            | 3           |\n",
    "| 2    | 3            | 4           |\n",
    "| 3    | 4            | 5           |\n",
    "| 4    | 5            | 8           |\n",
    "\n",
    "And a knapsack with a weight capacity of $W = 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total value is maximized, and the total weight does not exceed 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can include Item 1 (weight = 2, value = 3) and Item 2 (weight = 3, value = 4), giving a total weight of $2 + 3 = 5$ and a total value of $3 + 4 = 7$.\n",
    "- Alternatively, we could include Item 3 (weight = 4, value = 5), which gives a total weight of 4 and a total value of 5.\n",
    "- Item 4 alone cannot be included, because its weight exceeds the knapsack's capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal solution is to include **Item 1** and **Item 2**, with a total value of **7** and a total weight of **5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Programming Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0/1 Knapsack Problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to build a table of subproblems where each entry represents the maximum value that can be obtained with a given number of items and a given knapsack capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrence Relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s define a 2D table `dp[i][w]` where:\n",
    "- $i$ represents the first $i$ items considered.\n",
    "- $w$ represents the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value in `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value achievable with the first $i$ items and a knapsack capacity of $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrence relation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dp[i][w] = \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "dp[i-1][w], & \\text{if } w_i > w \\\\\n",
    "\\max(dp[i-1][w], v_i + dp[i-1][w-w_i]), & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Case:\n",
    "If $i = 0$ or $w = 0$, then `dp[i][w] = 0`, because with 0 items or 0 weight capacity, the maximum value is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size $(n+1) \\times (W+1)$, where $n$ is the number of items and $W$ is the maximum weight.\n",
    "2. Iterate over all items $i$ and all possible weight capacities $w$.\n",
    "3. For each combination of item and capacity, apply the recurrence relation.\n",
    "4. The value in `dp[n][W]` will be the maximum value that can be obtained with $n$ items and a knapsack of capacity $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The size of the `dp` table is $O(nW)$, where $n$ is the number of items and $W$ is the maximum weight capacity.\n",
    "- Filling each cell of the table requires constant time.\n",
    "- Hence, the time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "O(nW)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is also $O(nW)$ because of the size of the 2D table.\n",
