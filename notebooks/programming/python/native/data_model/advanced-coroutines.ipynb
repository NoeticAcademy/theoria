    "Probably a waste of time. As a comment suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "There's very little useful about this library. It is misrepresented even in its own documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it actually does:\n",
    "It utilizes a particular operating system API to perform networking I/O (at transport level, i.e. TCP or UDP), in an asynchronous way, where the I/O is scheduled and then the system is polled repeatedly to figure out if the scheduled I/O was completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, asyncio is useless when it comes to files, or dealing with other kinds of I/O. asyncio is particularly useless when you aren't doing any I/O (i.e. you are trying to run some computations in parallel).\n",
    "\n",
    "In yet another words: if you are writing anything other than a socket server / client, you have no business using this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it's advertised as:\n",
    "And yet... this library is forced as some kind of solution for concurrent programming in Python. It's absurd, because it cannot achieve it in principle, and it's idiotic because the interface is a walking disaster. It is another stupid fashion trend in Python community, which resulted from some inferiority complex, where Python programmers feel bad for their language not having any decent tools to run simultaneous computations, and, specifically, async sounds hip, and has been recently added to a bunch of other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, not wanting to trail behind the fashion, Python added it too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't feel bad for not understanding how asyncio works. It's a poorly designed library, that is also intentionally misleading about what it does. You don't lose anything of substance if you don't use this library at all. (If you want the same functionality, you can just use select module, with a much more straight-forward interface, and a lot less bloat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are third-party libraries that rely on asyncio. And, sometimes, you have no choice but to embrace this nonsense, if you really need to use that other library... If that's the case, please except my condolences. You will have to read the documentation and go through examples, until you \"get it\". Enough has been written about it.\n",
