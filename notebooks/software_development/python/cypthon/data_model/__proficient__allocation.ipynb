    "CPython's memory system provides a self-contained, high-performance solution for managing the lifecycle of all objects on a dedicated private heap, integrated seamlessly with the PyMalloc arena allocator for optimal small-object performance. This architecture ensures that every value - scalars, collections, functions, classes, and custom instances - At the top level, Python keeps names and stack frames (local variables, call stack) separate from objects on the heap (lists, dicts, your Tick instances).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do `x = Tick(...)`, the name x is just a reference; the actual Tick object lives on the heap and can be pointed to by many names or containers. Every heap object has a reference count; when this count drops to zero (no references anywhere), CPython immediately frees that object’s memory back to its allocator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also runs a cyclic garbage collector to clean up groups of objects that reference each other in cycles and would otherwise escape simple reference countingundergoes identical allocation, reference tracking, and deallocation procedures, while arenas minimize system call overhead and fragmentation for the millions of tiny allocations typical in data-intensive applications."

    "Calling the OS allocator (`malloc`/`free` or `mmap`) for every small object would be too slow and fragment memory badly, so CPython uses pymalloc for small objects (up to a few hundred bytes).\n",
    "Pymalloc grabs memory from the OS in larger chunks and then sub-divides and reuses it, so most small-object allocations never talk to the OS at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, pymalloc uses three levels:\n",
    "* Arenas: big chunks from the OS (hundreds of KB or ~1MB, depending on version)\n",
    "* Pools: 4KB regions inside an arena, each pool dedicated to one size class\n",
    "* Blocks: fixed-size slots inside a pool, each block holding exactly one small object\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pool keeps bookkeeping information: which size class it serves, how many blocks are currently used, and a pointer to a free list of blocks that have been freed and are ready to be reused.  Arenas track which pools are still available and which are fully used; if all pools in all arenas for a size class are full, pymalloc will get another arena from the OS and carve out more pools."

    "When an object like a Tick is freed (its reference count reaches zero), its block does not go back to the OS immediately; instead, it is pushed onto the free list for that pool. The next time Python needs another object of the same size class, pymalloc first checks the free list for a pool of that size and can just pop a block off the list, which is extremely fast and cache-friendly.\n"
