    "# Concurrency - Reader-Writer Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "A read–write lock (also called a shared–exclusive lock) is a concurrency control primitive that allows multiple threads to access a shared resource efficiently when those threads are only performing read operations. In many systems, reads are far more frequent than writes, so allowing parallel reading can greatly improve performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The lock operates in two modes: **shared (read)** and **exclusive (write)**. When one or more threads acquire the lock in shared mode, they can safely read the data concurrently because none of them are mutating the underlying state. However, when a thread needs to modify that state, it must acquire the lock in exclusive mode. This prevents new readers from entering and blocks until all current readers have released their locks, ensuring that the writer has sole access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism strikes a balance between safety and throughput - maximizing concurrency during frequent reads while preserving strict consistency and atomicity during writes."
