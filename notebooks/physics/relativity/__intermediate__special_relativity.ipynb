    "## Part 1: Measuring stuff - Inertial frames and events\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with 2 observers, Alice and Bob. Bob is travelling at a constant speed $v$ along the $x$-axis relative to Alice. Our goal in this section is to describe how they measure events and how their measurements are related in the classical world (pre-Einstein!).\n",
    "\n",
    "An event is anything that happens that can be measured by when it happens (time) and where it happens (space).  For example, me typing the title of this notebook is an event - it happened around 21:15 GMT 2026-01-20 on Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice measures events using a coordinate system with coordinates labelled by $(t,x,y,z)$, $t$ being time, and $(x,y,z)$ being space. This system is called Alice's inertial frame. Similarly, Bob measures events using a coordinate system with coordinates labelled by $(t', x', y', z')$. For simplicity, we will align their frames so that they have the same origin. All we are saying here is that Alice and Bob were at the same place at the beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose Alice measures an event to be at $p_1 = (t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$ in her frame. Bob is moving at speed $v$ along the $x$-axis relative to Alice, so in Bob's point of view, the event must happen a bit more to the left at $p_1' = (t_1, x_1 - vt_1, y_1, z_1)$, i.e $t_1'=t_1, x_1' = x_1 - vt_1, y_1'=y_1, z_1'=z_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're Bob and you're running the 100m race. Your friend Alice is at the start line cheering you on. As the race begins, you start running away from Alice at speed 10 m/s. After 5 seconds, you're 50m away from Alice, but one of the other runners, who is super fast, is already at the 75m mark. Alice measures the event of this fast runner reaching the 75m mark with coordinates (5s, 75m, 0, 0). But this super fast runner is only 25m = 75m - (10 m/s) * 5s in front of you, so relative to you, this event has coordinates (5s, 25m, 0, 0). \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we view the relationship between Alice's and Bob's inertial frames as a linear coordinate transformation:\n",

    "**Key:** Inertial frames = point of view!\n",

    "Suppose now that according to Alice, a light ray was emitted at $p_1 = (t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and absorbed at $p_2 = (t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The light ray was shone along the $x$-axis, so $y_1 = y_2, z_1 = z_2$. Alice measures the speed of light to be $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s by taking the ratio of the difference in distance and difference in time of the events: $x_2 - x_1 = c(t_2 - t_1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does Bob see? The coordinates of these events in Bob's inertial frame are $(t_1, x_1 - vt_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(t_2, x_2 - v t_2, y_1, z_1)$. Recalling that Bob's natural $x$-coordinates are $x_{1,2}' = x_{1,2} - v t_{1,2}$, we find that the spatial distance of these events as measured by Bob is $x_2' - x_1' = (c-v)(t_2 - t_1)$. This means that Bob actually sees the light ray having speed $c-v$ instead of $c$. This (kind of) makes sense! Again, if we're running away from Alice and she throws a ball at us, we see the ball a bit slower than Alice does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Experiments tell us that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, so Bob should actually see the light ray having speed $c$ instead of $c-v$. This means that our analysis of Bob's inertial frame relative to Alice's is wrong. Well it's not very wrong; it's actually pretty good when Bob is not traveling close to the speed of light! In the next section, we will see how we can resolve this paradox.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2a: Fixing the speed of light - time is not the same for everyone\n",
    "\n",
    "For light to have constant speed in all inertial frames, we need to challenge our assumptions on how we measure events. The assumption that turns out to be wrong is that Alice and Bob measures time in the same way --- we assumed that if Alice measures 5 seconds bewteen 2 events, Bob measures 5 seconds between the same events, no matter how fast he is going relative to Alice. In other words, we assumed that there was a concept of absolute time that everyone agrees on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how relaxing absolute time resolves the issue of the constancy of the speed of light. Alice again measures the events between a light ray being emitted and it being absorbed. They occur at $(t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$. We make no assumptions that the light ray was shone along a particular axis, so $y_2 \\neq y_1$, and similarly for the other directions. Denote by \n",

    "\n",
    "This is enough for us to deduce what coordinate transformations from Alice's to Bob's frames are consistent with the constancy of the speed of light. We need 2 facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The transformation from Alice's coordinate vector $X$ to Bob's coordinate vector $X'$ must be linear and constant; i.e. $X' = LX$ where the matrix $L$ is a constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Any constant, linear transformation $L$ that preserves the zero cone $X^T\\eta X = 0$ (this is a fancy way of saying that if $s^2 = 0$ in one frame, it is 0 in all frames) must be such that $(LX)^T\\eta LX = X^T L^T\\eta L X = \\lambda X^T\\eta X$, where $\\lambda$ is a constant. This means that $(s')^2 = \\lambda s^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To justify fact 1, we note that any other transformation will cause fictitious forces (accelerations), like how you feel pushed to the left when the car you are in turns right. These accelerations cause the frames to be non-inertial and are not part of our discussions here. For fact 2, the proof is found in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's follow on from fact 2, and work with a concrete example. Bob is moving relative to Alice at speed $v$ along her $x$-axis. This means that the linear transformation $L$ is a function of $v$, $L = L(v)$. Similarly the constant $\\lambda = \\lambda(v)$. What can $\\lambda(v)$ be? Firstly, if $v=0$, Alice and Bob share the same inertial frame, so $\\lambda(0) = 1$. Next, $\\lambda$ cannot depend on the direction that Bob is travelling relative to Alice, only his speed, so $\\lambda(v) = \\lambda(-v)$ (same for $L$); one can demonstrate this explicitly by reflecting the $x$-axis. What this means is that since Alice is travelling at speed $v$ relative to Bob (just in the opposite direction), she must measure the interval to be $\\lambda(v)$ of Bob's value. Thus $s^2 = \\lambda(v)^2s^2$, giving $\\lambda(v)^2 = 1$. Since $\\lambda(0) = 1$, we must have $\\lambda(v) = 1$ for all $v$, otherwise there will be a discontinuity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that the interval $s^2$ between 2 events is an invariant quantity. Every observer in every inertial frame agrees on this number. This is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection (group) of all linear transformations $L$ that preserves $s^2$ is the same as those obeying $L^T\\eta L=\\eta$ (this is a corollary of the proof of fact 2). This group is called the Lorentz group and elements of it are called Lorentz transformations. \n",

    "Let's derive the form of the Lorentz transformation $L$ in Alice's and Bob's example. Again, Alice and Bob share the same origin and Bob is moving away from Alice at speed $v$ along the positive $x$-axis.

    "Let's fix Bob's speed relative to Alice's to be $v = 0.6c$. This is very, very fast (around 200 million meters per second). The boost factor is \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = 1.25 \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Bob has a stopwatch and he uses it to measure $\\Delta t' = 1$ second. In terms of events, Bob measured 2 events located at same place spatially, but temporally separated by 1 second:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p_1' = (0, 0, 0, 0) \\,,\\quad p_2' = (\\Delta t', 0, 0, 0) \\,.\n",

    "How does Alice see these events? In her inertial frame, these events have coordinates\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p_1 = (0, 0, 0, 0) \\,,\\quad p_2' = (1.25 \\times \\Delta t', -0.75\\times c\\Delta t', 0, 0) \\,,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "which we obtain by using the Lorentz transformation we derived earlier. The time difference that Alice observes is\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Delta t = 1.25 \\times \\Delta t' \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "This is 1.25 times longer than what Bob measured himself. We call this time dilation --- **moving clocks run more slowly than stationary ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is therefore a bit weird. What about space? Firstly, let's define what it means by measuring the length of something. Say that Bob is carrying a ruler that is aligned to his $x$ axis. If he measures this ruler to be of length $L'$, what he actually did was observe 2 events that happened **at the same time** with coordinates\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p_1' = (0, 0, 0, 0) \\,,\\quad p_2' = (0, L', 0, 0) \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$p_1'$ corresponds to the location of the left-end of the ruler, $p_2'$ the right-end, and we assumed Bob measured these events at time $t'=0$ for convenience. Alice tries to measure the length of the ruler as well and measures it to be of length $L$. Again, what this means is that at some time $t$, Alice sees the left-end and right-end of the ruler to have coordinates\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "q_1 = (t, x, 0, 0) \\,,\\quad q_2 = (t, x + L, 0, 0) \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "To relate $L$ and $L'$ let's look at how Bob view Alice's events. In Bob's frame, distance along the $x$ direction of these events is\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Delta x' = 1.25 \\times L \\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "This must equal $L'$, so we find that \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "L' = 1.25\\times L \\implies L = 0.8\\times L'\\,.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Recall that $L'$ is the proper length of the ruler. It is the length of the object measured in the frame that is stationary relative to the object. What this equation tells us is then that Alice sees the ruler to be 80% shorter than how Bob sees it. This is length contraction --- **moving rulers are shorter than stationary ones**."

Mathematically, this means that the laws of physics must be Lorentz covariant. A law of physics is really just an equation. It has a left-hand-side and a right-hand-side. A Lorentz covariant law of physics just means that the left-hand-side and right-hand-side transform **in the same way** under Lorentz transformations (changes of inertial frames). \n",
