    "\n",
    "Avellaneda & Stoikov (2006)'s paper *High-frequency trading in a limit order book* develops an **optimal (stock) market-making strategy** for HFT in a stochastic limit order book. A dealer dynamically posts bid/ask quotes to capture spreads while controlling inventory risk through continuous-time optimal stochastic control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional optimization frameworks address **two core risks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inventory risk**: Uncertainty in the value of dealer holdings $q_t$. Under diffusive mid-price dynamics $dS_u = \\sigma dW_u$, the terminal wealth $X_T + q_T S_T$ exhibits quadratic variance $\\text{Var}(q_T S_T) = q_T^2 \\sigma^2 T$, which escalates rapidly with $|q_t|$, where $X_T$ is cash earned from realised spreads.\n",
    "* **Asymmetric information risk** (adverse selection): Informed traders exploit stale quotes, capturing the economic spread while the dealer earns only microstructure edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper primarily tackles **inventory risk optimization** via a (asymptotically) tractable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE, deriving inventory-aware reservation prices $r(t,q_t)$ and optimal spreads that naturally mean-revert positions toward zero."

    "dS_u = \\sigma dW_u\n",
    "$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over ultra-short HFT horizons (seconds to minutes), the drift $\\mu \\approx 0$ because the daily risk premium is dwarfed by volatility - trends and mean-reversion govern longer scales (hours+). \n",
    "\n",
    "This driftless diffusion is mathematically crucial: paired with CARA utility $u(x) = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma}e^{-\\gamma x}$, it enables a (asymptotically) tractable HJB PDE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Brownian motion $dS_u = \\sigma S_u\\,dW_u$ delivers equivalent short-horizon asymptotics but demands lognormal algebra which encounters issues with mathematical infinities; for simplicity we make no further mention of it here. Arithmetic Brownian motion $dS_u = \\sigma\\,dW_u$ streamlines derivations without much loss of generality. High-frequency empirical calibration (Avellaneda-Stoikov 2008; Gu\\'eant 2016) confirms the approximation holds over 1-60s horizons.\n",

    "### Orders\n",
    "The agent quotes limit orders at distances $\\delta^a, \\delta^b > 0$ from their reference price. Intuitively, smaller $\\delta$ means higher priority - your order sits closer to the best bid/ask and executes first against incoming market orders.\n",

    "Consider a large market order of size $Q$ at price $p^Q$. The top $Q$ best limit asks execute, with market impact defined as $\\Delta p := p^Q - s$. A limit ask at $p^a$ executes if $\\delta^a < \\Delta p$ - your quote must be \"aggressive\" enough to be reached by the aggressive market order.\n",

    "\\lambda^a(\\delta^a), \\quad \\lambda^b(\\delta^b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, quotes further from the mid-price execute less frequently - far-away orders only fill against very aggressive market orders. Econophysics literature supports this: market order sizes follow a power law $f^Q(x) \\propto x^{-1-\\alpha}$ (large orders are rare), and impact satisfies $\\Delta p \\propto \\ln(Q)$ (big orders walk the book deeper).\n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity derives as:\n",
