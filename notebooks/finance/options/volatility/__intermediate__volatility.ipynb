    "In finance, volatility is the magnitude of an asset’s price or return fluctuations over time, typically quantified as the standard deviation of returns and used as a practical proxy for risk. A highly volatile asset exhibits large, frequent deviations from its average return, while a low‑volatility asset tends to move in smaller, more clustered steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this broad concept, it is useful to distinguish between different flavours of volatility. \n",
    "* Realized volatility is a backward‑looking, purely statistical measure computed from historical returns over a chosen window (for example, the annualized standard deviation of the last 21 daily log returns). \n",
    "* Implied volatility, by contrast, is a forward‑looking quantity inferred from option prices: it is the volatility input that makes a pricing model (such as Black–Scholes) reproduce observed option premiums and therefore embeds the market’s expectation of future variability plus any volatility risk premium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of options trading and risk management revolves around comparing these two “views” of the same underlying uncertainty: the volatility the market is pricing in today versus the volatility that has actually been realized in the past and is expected to realize going forward.\n"

    "We can classify volatility modelling into three broad categories. The point of splitting them this way is to make clear what you are modelling (realized paths vs. priced risk) and what decision each model supports: forecasting risk, pricing derivatives, or arbitraging the gap between the two. In other words, you want a clean pipeline from beliefs about the real world to risk‑neutral prices and then to trades that are explicitly about the implied-realized volatility spread.\n",
