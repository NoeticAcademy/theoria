    "# CPython - Deallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s memory management combines reference counting for immediacy with a generational garbage collector for the hard cases. Every object carries an ob_refcnt field in its header that tracks how many active references point to it; creating or sharing a reference increments the count, and dropping a reference decrements it. When an object’s count reaches zero, CPython deallocates it immediately and recursively decrements the counts of any objects it owns, which makes most cleanup prompt and predictable. To handle reference cycles that refcounting alone cannot reclaim, CPython layers a three‑generation garbage collector on top: new objects start in the youngest generation and are periodically scanned for unreachable cycles, with survivors promoted to older generations that are collected less frequently to keep overhead low."

    "\n",
    "In CPython, reference counting always runs first and handles almost all deallocation on its own. Every object carries an ob_refcnt counter; when your code creates or shares a reference (assigning to a variable, passing an argument, storing in a list), the counter is incremented, and when a reference goes away (variable reassigned, frame returns, container element removed), it is decremented. When a Py_DECREF call drives ob_refcnt to zero, CPython immediately invokes the object’s tp_dealloc (for example list_dealloc), freeing the object and recursively decreasing the refcounts of any objects it owns, so most memory is reclaimed instantly without involving the generational garbage collector at all."

That's where generational GC steps in as the safety net, using three age-based generations. New objects land in Gen0 (scanned often), survivors promote to Gen1 then Gen2 (scanned rarely—most long-lived objects settle here), triggered when uncollected allocations exceed a per-generation threshold."

    "The GC runs a mark-and-sweep dance: first, it marks everything reachable from roots (stack frames, globals, registers) by traversing containers like lists and dicts. Unmarked objects become garbage candidates, even in cycles. Then it sweeps, clearing weak references and `__del__` finalizers before deallocating—while promoting survivors to the next generation. This hybrid keeps Python responsive: refcount zaps 99% of objects instantly, GC quietly handles the rare loops.\\\n",

    "*   Gen 0: collect when its counter passes ~700.\n",

    "Alternatively, you can force a collection at any time with gc.collect(), or target a generation with gc.collect(0), gc.collect(1), or gc.collect(2). You can also disable or re‑enable automatic GC with gc.disable() / gc.enable(), and tune thresholds using `gc.set_threshold(...)` if you want fewer or more frequent collections. This is a blocking action so may be slow.\n"

This is particularly useful for niche types of caching; a weak‑reference cache lets you remember objects if they are still alive elsewhere, but automatically drop them when the rest of the program stops using them, so the cache does not cause memory leaks. weakref.WeakValueDictionary is perfect for this: it maps keys to objects, but the values are held only weakly, so entries disappear when the objects are garbage‑collected."
