    "## RFR Swap Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition away from IBORs (e.g. LIBOR) toward risk-free rates (RFRs) such as SOFR, SONIA and €STR was driven by both structural weaknesses of IBOR rates and regulatory imperatives. IBORs are:\n",
    "- survey-based or judgment-based rates (easily manipulated),\n",
    "- referencing unsecured term interbank funding,\n",
    "- increasingly illiquid and unrepresentative post-2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, RFRs are:\n",
    "- transaction-based,\n",
    "- overnight rates referencing deep and liquid markets,\n",
    "- largely free of bank credit and liquidity premia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economically, IBORs attempt to represent a *term unsecured funding rate*, whereas RFRs represent the *near risk-free marginal cost of overnight funding*. The disappearance of a deep unsecured term funding market rendered IBORs fundamentally unstable, while overnight funding markets remained robust even during periods of stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, RFRs became the natural foundation for:\n",
    "- discounting (already established via OIS discounting),\n",
    "- floating legs of swaps,\n",
    "- benchmark yield curve construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RFR Mechanism: Backward-Looking Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike IBORs, RFRs are **overnight rates**. There is no directly observable term RFR fixing. Therefore, RFR swap coupons must be constructed from overnight rates over an accrual period. The market standard is the backward-looking compounded overnight rate. Over an accrual period $[T_{i-1},T_i]$, the compounded RFR is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^{\\text{RFR}}(T_{i-1},T_i) :=\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\tau_i}\n",
    "\\left(\n",
    "\\prod_{k: \\, T_{i-1} \\leq t_k < T_i}\n",
    "\\big(1+\\delta_k r_{t_k}\\big)\n",
    "-1\n",
    "\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $r_{t_k}$ is the overnight RFR fixing on day $t_k$,\n",
    "- $\\delta_k$ is the overnight day-count fraction,\n",
    "- $\\tau_i = \\sum_k \\delta_k \\approx T_i - T_{i-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rate is **backward-looking** (i.e. uses only realised past data):\n",
    "- the coupon is fully known only at $T_i$,\n",
    "- there is no fixing at $T_{i-1}$,\n",
    "- FRAs cannot be defined directly on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economically, the floating leg represents the realised cost of rolling overnight funding over the accrual period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, one could define a forward-looking term RFR as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\n",

    "\\right],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "but this object:\n",
    "- is not observable, and\n",
    "- is model dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it defeats the regulatory motivation behind RFR adoption. Hence, market conventions deliberately avoid forward-looking RFRs.\n",
