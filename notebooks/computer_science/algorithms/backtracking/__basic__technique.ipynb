    "# Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing solutions that fail to satisfy the problem’s constraints at any point (pruning).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of backtracking is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try a choice among available options.\n",
    "* Recursively continue to build a solution with that choice included.\n",
    "* If the choice leads to a conflict or dead end (not a solution), undo the choice (backtrack) and try the next option.\n",
    "* Continue until all solutions are found or the problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often implemented using recursion and is useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constraint satisfaction problems (like Sudoku, N-Queens).\n",
    "* Combinatorial problems (permutations, combinations).\n",
    "* Searching in decision trees or graphs.\n"
